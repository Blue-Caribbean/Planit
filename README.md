## Introduction

This was a brief project to create an MVP for an external user.

## The App

The external user was looking for an easy to use event planning app: a tool to allow them to invite their friends to the platform where each user could briefly input their standard availability, and then see other group members' availability. Users could create, browse, and join groups as well as invite people to groups. Group members would be able to create new events during time blocks with group availability, and invite friends to events.
