## Introduction
This was a brief sprint where we created an MVP for an external user.

## The App
The external user was looking for an easy to use event planning app. Something that would allow them to invite their friends to the platform, let them briefly input their standard availability, and then see other group members availability. Group members would be able to create events, and invite other friends to events.

## Tech Stack
* Express
* Node
* PostgreSQL
* React
